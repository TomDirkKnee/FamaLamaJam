# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** Musicians can reliably join and complete real Ninjam rehearsals directly inside Ableton using a stable VST3 plugin workflow.  
**Current focus:** Phase 7 - Chat & Room Control Commands

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 10 planned (Chat & Room Control Commands)  
Plan: 1 of 3 completed in current phase (next: 07-02)  
Status: In progress  
Last activity: 2026-03-17 - Completed 07-01 with typed room-message transport, processor-owned room state, and Phase 7 integration coverage.

Progress: 63%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 3 timing is server-authoritative with no fake local fallback during reconnect or timing loss.
- Remote interval playback is boundary-quantized: ready sources switch together, late intervals are skipped, and reconnect clears stale remote playback before realignment.
- Experimental streaming now uploads full authoritative intervals, not opportunistic latest blocks, so remote interval semantics match the sync model.
- Transport UI sync health is explicit: disconnected, waiting for timing, healthy, reconnecting, and timing lost.
- Phase 5 is closed as a validated v1 rehearsal baseline, not as a declaration that the whole product is feature-complete.
- The next milestone order is fixed: host sync assist research first, then chat/voting, then server discovery/history, then layout refresh, then advanced parity research.
- Phase 6 is locked around an explicit one-shot "Arm Sync to Ableton Play" workflow with real room timing required and arming blocked when Ableton tempo does not match room BPM.
- [Phase 06]: Keep host sync assist read-only and one-shot - Phase 6 proves host-start alignment without implying generic Ableton tempo or loop control.
- [Phase 06]: Treat armed waiting and failed starts as explicit transport hold states - This preserves the server-authoritative model and prevents silent fallback after missing host timing data.
- [Phase 06]: Use a conservative 0.05 BPM tolerance for host tempo matching - Host tempo floats can vary slightly, but the arm gate still needs to stay strict and predictable.
- [Phase 06]: Derive armed, blocked, and failed wording from processor-owned snapshot data rather than editor-local sync logic.
- [Phase 06]: Preserve a short canceled message as transient UI feedback after the user disarms the assist.
- [Phase 06]: Keep host sync assist as a secondary transport-area action with explicit room target copy.
- [Phase 06]: Phase 6 closes with a narrow read-only Ableton host-start assist, not generic DAW transport control.
- [Phase 06]: Untested Ableton timing-loss and failed-start paths stay documented as residual risk instead of being inferred as passed.
- [Phase 07]: Keep room commands on a typed `MESSAGE_CHAT_MESSAGE` path separate from upload interval framing.
- [Phase 07]: Drain room events into processor-owned session-only state outside `processBlock()` so chat/topic parsing never lands on the realtime path.
- [Phase 07]: Preserve empty-author room notices in the mixed feed and classify vote-related system feedback instead of dropping unknown server text.

### Pending Todos

- Execute 07-02 and 07-03 to wire the compact room UI and final Phase 7 validation.
- Keep using the verified `build-vs` validation path until local Ninja reliability is revisited.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Local Windows Ninja/CMake remains unreliable on this machine; use the verified `build-vs` path for now.
- Phase 6 validated the healthy-path Ableton host-start workflow, but the timing-loss cancellation and failed-start re-arm paths were not manually exercised in Ableton.

### Performance Metrics

- 2026-03-16: Completed Phase 06 plan 02 in 10 min across 3 task commits and 6 modified files.
- 2026-03-16: Completed Phase 06 plan 03 in 28 min across 3 task commits and 6 modified files.
- 2026-03-17: Completed Phase 07 plan 01 in 11 min across 2 task commits and 7 modified files.
